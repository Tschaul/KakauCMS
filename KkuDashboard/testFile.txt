If this fragmentation-reagglomeration cycle is repeated sufficiently often, the powder develops a fractal substructure with robust statistical properties. The structural evolution is discussed for two different models: The first one is an off-lattice model, in which a fragment does not stick to the surface of other fragments that have already settled, but rolls down until it finds a locally stable position. The second one is a simpler lattice model, in which a fragment sticks at first contact with the agglomerate of fragments that have already settled. Results for the fragment size distribution are shown as well. One can distinguish scale invariant dust and fragments of a characteristic size. Their role in the process of structure formation will be addressed.","pdf":"pdf\/09_Wolf_et_al_P+G.pdf","condmat":"","imageUrl":""}

Molecular dynamics simulations show, in a wide range of parameters, a close-packed cluster supported by a low-density region. Surprisingly, the steady-state density profile, including the close-packed cluster part, is well described by a variant of Navier-Stokes granular hydrodynamics (NSGH). We suggest a simple explanation for the success of NSGH beyond the freezing point.","pdf":"pdf\/2003_Meerson_Poeschel_prl.pdf","condmat":"http:\/\/xxx.lanl.gov\/abs\/cond-mat\/0305657","imageUrl":""}

The rate of energy loss indicates three different phases in the amplitude-frequency plane of the external forcing, namely solid, convective and gas-like regimes. The behavior of the effective damping decrement is consistent with the glassy nature of granular solids. The gas-like regime is most promising for practical applications.","pdf":"pdf\/spie98.pdf","condmat":"","imageUrl":""}

A numerical hydrodynamic solver is presented for a vibrated granular bed in two dimensions. It is based on a highly accurate shock capturing state-of-the-art numerical scheme applied to a compressible Navier-Stokes system for granular flow. The hydrodynamic simulation of granular flows is challenging, particularly in systems where dilute and dense regions occur at the same time and interact with each other. As a benchmark experiment, we investigate the formation of Faraday waves in a two-dimensional thin layer exposed to vertical vibration in the presence of gravity. The results of the hydrodynamic simulations are compared with those of event-driven molecular dynamics and the overall quantitative agreement is good at the level of the formation and structure of periodic patterns. The accurate numerical scheme for the hydrodynamic description improves the reproduction of the primary onset of patterns compared to previous literature. To our knowledge, these are the first hydrodynamic results for Faraday waves in two-dimensional granular beds that accurately predict the wavelengths of the two-dimensional standing waves as a function of the perturbation's amplitude.

The density profile of the system agrees very well with the azimuthally symmetric solution of granular hydrostatic equations employing constitutive relations by Grossman et al., whereas the widely used Enskog-type constitutive relations show poor accuracy. We find that fluctuations of the center of mass of the system are Gaussian.
